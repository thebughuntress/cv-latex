%---------------------------------------------------------
Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience. Since the beginning of my career, I have contributed to diverse projects across industries like telecommunications, automotive, and energy, building applications from scratch, implementing new features, and finding solutions. My preference is working in a command-line interface environment and using Python over Java as a programming language.\\
Beyond my technical skills, I am flexible, communicative, and motivated to expand my knowledge, master new concepts and share knowledge. If there are any technologies or tools that I am not yet familiar with, I am committed to learn them.
